# BAS Orchestrator

SafeBreach-style campaign orchestrator for running bounded, reproducible BAS simulations, collecting evidence, and scoring control coverage.

Status: **backlog → scaffolded (in progress)**

## What it does
- Loads campaign specs (YAML) describing targets, modules, schedules, and success criteria.
- Dispatches modules to agents (local runner in MVP; remote agents later).
- Produces a signed evidence pack (JSON) with timestamps, module results, and scoring.

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]

bas init examples/basic-campaign.yaml
bas run examples/basic-campaign.yaml --out evidence.json
bas run examples/basic-campaign.yaml --out evidence.json --deterministic
```

## Example campaign
See `examples/basic-campaign.yaml` for a minimal end-to-end campaign spec.

## Docker
```bash
docker build -t bas-orchestrator .
```

## Security notes
- No authentication yet (local-first, single-operator MVP).
- Modules are strictly bounded and must declare prerequisites and safe scopes.
- Evidence packs are append-only and intended for audit workflows.
